# Contributing

## Guidelines

1. Don't be rude.

## Get started

1. Fork & clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```
   cd react-native-vision-camera
   yarn bootstrap
   ```

Read the READMEs in [`android/`](android/README.md), [`ios/`](ios/README.md), and [`cpp/`](cpp/README.md) for a quick overview of the development workflow.

> You can also open VisionCamera in [a quick online editor (github1s)](https://github1s.com/cuvent/react-native-vision-camera)

### iOS

1. Open the `example/ios/VisionCameraExample.xcworkspace` file with Xcode
2. Change signing configuration to your developer account
3. Select your device in the devices drop-down
4. Hit run

> Run `yarn check-ios` to validate codestyle

### Android

1. Open the `example/android/` folder with Android Studio
2. Select your device in the devices drop-down
3. Hit run

> Run `yarn check-android` to validate codestyle

### C++

The C++ codebase is shared between Android and iOS. This means you can make changes to those files in either the Android example or the iOS example, but make sure to test changes on both platforms.

> Run `yarn check-cpp` to validate codestyle

## Committing

We love to keep our codebases clean. To achieve that, we use linters and formatters which output errors when something isn't formatted the way we like it to be.

Before pushing your changes, you can verify that everything is still correctly formatted by running all linters:

```
yarn check-all
```

This validates Swift, Kotlin, C++ and JS/TS code:

```bash
$ yarn check-all
   yarn run v1.22.10
   Formatting Swift code..
   Linting Swift code..
   Linting Kotlin code..
   Linting JS/TS code..
   All done!
   ✨  Done in 8.05s.
